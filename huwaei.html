<p class = "normal">Huawei is a Chinese multinational technology company that provides telecommunication equipment, sells consumer electronics and smartphones. It's the second largest telecommunication in the world, behind Samsung but ahead of Apple.</p>

<p class = "normal">Despite being the world's leading telecom supplier, phone manufacturer and cloud services, Huawei has been seen as a pariah in countries like the US. Despite its massive presence in the world, as of December 12, 2019, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Taiwan and the U.S. have decided to ban and phase out the company's products within their mobile networks. Not only that, the United States also urged allies to prevent Huawei from using its next-generation 5G wireless network.</p>

<p class = "normal">The main concern with Huawei has been its association with the Chinese government and doubts that its equipment can be used to spy on other countries. The officials are also concerned that Huawei might sell devices comprised with "backdoors" that allow Chinese government hackers access data or surveillance. </p>

<p class = "normal">Huawei itself has always denied such allegations. The decision to ban Huawei is also the result of an escalating trade war between US and China. </p>

<p class = "normal">For years, the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigations), the NSA (National Security Agency) have dug up close ties between Huawei and the Chinese Communist Party. At a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing in February 2018, top US intelligence chiefs said Huawei and another Chinese tech company, ZTE, posed potential national security risks to the US and warned American companies about doing business with them. </p>

<p class = "normal">The US believes that Huawei is an epitome of variety of fears about China and its technological prowess packed into a single company. US has always been anxious about China surpassing the West's technological prowess and Huawei does have the resources to do so. In 2018, the company said it would increase annual spending on Research & Development to $15 billion to $20 billion annually, and it has tens of thousands of patents in China and abroad. </p>

<p class = "normal">People are yet to find a back door in a Huawei product as per Adam Segal, director of the Digital and Cyberspace Policy Program at the Council on Foreign Relations. </p>

<p class = "normal">But the risks surrounding Huawei increases with the oncoming "Fifth-Generation" - 5G technology.</p>

<p class = "normal">5G enables a new kind of network that is designed to connect virtually everyone and everything together including machines, objects, and devices. It is meant to deliver higher data speeds, more reliability, massive network capacity, increased availability, and a more uniform user experience to more users. </p>

<p class = "normal">Huawei is one the major providers of products that consist of super-fast 5G networks globally. The US has pressured its allies to find an alternative to this as it opens a huge opportunity for Huawei for data surveillance and manipulation. </p>

<p class = "normal">The worries about Huawei have stemmed from the following facts that the company's founder, Ren Zhengfei, was a former technician for the People's Liberation Army of China and also tens of billions of dollars that the Chinese government has invested into the company. Also, China's passage of the cybersecurity laws in 2017 that enables or compels corporations to assist the Chinese government in offensive intelligence operations. </p>

<p class = "normal">In 2011, Huawei answered with an open letter to the US government stating a thorough investigations from the American officials would reveal that Huawei was nothing but a normal commercial institution. </p>

<p class = "normal">This prompted the 2012 House Intelligence Committee report on Huawei that said, "the company did not fully cooperate with the investigations and was unwilling to explain its relationship with the Chinese government or Chinese Communist Party." </p>

<p class = "normal">In 2014, the US completely banned Huawei from bidding on US government contracts which followed US President Donald Trump signing a bill that prevented the use of Huawei products by the US government or the associated contractors. Subsequently, Pentagon also banned Huawei phones at US military bases. </p>

<p class = "normal">This definitely prompted AT&T to back out of a deal with Huawei to sell its smartphones in the US. The Federal Communications Commission also proposed a new rule that would stop US companies purchasing equipment services from China. </p>

<p class = "normal">Canada and United Kingdom have also shown concerns about the risks associated with working with Huawei and 5G deployment. Japan has also banned Huawei and ZTE (A Chinese multinational telecommunication equipment and systems company) in the same manner as the US. </p>

<p class = "normal">This tension is unlikely to end soon. </p>
