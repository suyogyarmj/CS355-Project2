research is being conducted on this treatment, and the World Health Organization is 
accelerating the study and research on this subject in coordination with various partners.

8.	Is a hand dryer effective for killing the Corona virus?

A hand dryer can never be effective for killing the Corona virus. The best way to prevent 
Corona virus infection is to use a hand wash or alcoholic sanitizer with soapy water

for the prevention of Corona virus, it is recommended to apply these vaccines to 
prevent respiratory problems.
